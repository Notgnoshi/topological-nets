\begin{abstract}
	We have already seen that sequences are ``adequate'' to detect limit points, continuous functions, and compact sets in metrizable spaces. There is a generalization of the notion of a sequence, called a \textit{net}, that will do the same for an arbitrary topological space.

\section{Directed Sets}
\begin{defn}
	A relation $\preceq$ on a set $A$ is called a \textbf{partial order} relation if the following conditions hold:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\alpha \preceq \alpha$ for all $\alpha \in A$.
		\item If $\alpha \preceq \beta$ and $\beta \preceq \alpha$, then $\alpha = \beta$.
		\item If $\alpha \preceq \beta$ and $\beta \preceq \gamma$, then $\alpha \preceq \gamma$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{directed set} $J$ is a set with a partial order $\preceq$ such that for each pair $\alpha, \beta$ of elements of $J$, there exists an element $\gamma \in J$ with the property that $\alpha \preceq \gamma$ and $\beta \preceq \gamma$.
\end{defn}
Show the following are directed sets.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Any simply ordered set under the relation $\leq$.
	\item The collection of all subsets of a set $S$, partially ordered by inclusion. That is, $A \preceq B$ if $A \subset B$.
	\item The collection $\mathscr A$\todo{What's the right font for this?}{} of subsets of $S$ that is closed under finite intersections, partially ordered by reverse inclusion. That is, $A \preceq B$ if $B \subset A$.
	\item The collection of all closed subsets of a space $X$, partially ordered by inclusion.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Cofinal Sets}
\begin{defn}
	A subset $K \subset J$ is said to be \textbf{cofinal} in $J$ if for each $\alpha \in J$, there exists a $\beta \in K$ such that $\alpha \preceq \beta$.
\end{defn}

Show that if $J$ is directed, and $K$ is cofinal in $J$, then $K$ is directed.

\begin{proof}
	\todo{Prove.}
\end{proof}

\section{Nets and Convergence}
\begin{defn}
	Let $X$ be a topological space. A \textbf{net} in $X$ is a function $f$ from a directed set $J$ into $X$. If $\alpha \in J$, we usually denote $f(\alpha)$ by $x_\alpha$. We denote the net $f$ itself by ${\left(x_\alpha\right)}_{\alpha \in J}$, or simply $(x_\alpha)$ if $J$ is understood.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
	The net $(x_\alpha)$ is said to \textbf{converge} to a point $x \in X$, denoted by $x_\alpha \to x$ if for each neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there exists an $\alpha \in J$ such that
	\[\alpha \preceq \beta \Longrightarrow x_\beta \in U\]
\end{defn}

Show that these definitions are equivalent to those of a sequence and the convergence of a sequence when $J = \Z_+$

\begin{proof}
	\todo{Prove net $\sim$ sequence}
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}
	\todo{Prove net convergence $\sim$ sequence convergence}
\end{proof}

\section{Convergence in a Product Space}
Suppose that $(x_\alpha)$ converges to $x$ in $X$ and $(y_\alpha)$ converges to $y$ in $Y$. Show that $(x_\alpha \times y_\alpha)$ converges to $x \times y$ in $X \times Y$.
\begin{proof}
	\todo{Prove.}
\end{proof}

\section{Convergence in a Hausdorff Space}
Show that if $X$ is Hausdorff, a net in $X$ converges to at most one point.
\begin{proof}
	\todo{I smell contradiction.}
\end{proof}

\section{Closure of a Set}
\begin{thm}
	Let $A \in X$\todo{Is this a typo? Should it read ``Let $A \subset X$''?}{}. Then $x \in \overline A$ if and only if there is a net of points of $A$ converging to $x$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	\todo{To prove $\Rightarrow$, take as index set $J$ the collection of all neighborhoods of $x$, ordered by reverse inclusion.}
\end{proof}

\section{Continuity}
\begin{thm}
	Let $f: X \to Y$. Then $f$ is continuous if and only if for every convergent net $(x_\alpha)$ in $X$ converging to a pooint $x$, the net $\big(f(a_\alpha)\big)$ converges to $f(x)$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	\todo{Prove.}
\end{proof}

\section{Subnets}
\begin{defn}
	Let $f: J \to X$ be a net in $X$; let $f(\alpha) = x_\alpha$. If $K$ is a directed set and $g:K \to J$ is a function such that
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $i \preceq j \Rightarrow g(i) \preceq g(j)$
		\item $g(K)$ is cofinal in $J$
	\end{enumerate}
	then the composite function $f \circ g : K \to X$ is called a \textbf{subnet} if $(x_\alpha)$.
\end{defn}

Show that if the net $(x_\alpha)$ converges to $x$, so does any subnet of $(x_\alpha)$.
\begin{proof}
	\todo{Prove.}
\end{proof}

\section{Accumulation Points}
\begin{defn}
	Let ${(x_\alpha)}_{\alpha\in J}$ be a a net in $X$. We say that $x$ is an \textbf{accumulation point} of the net if for each neighborhood $U$ of $x$, the set of $\alpha$ for which $x_\alpha \in U$ is cofinal in $J$.
\end{defn}

\begin{lemma}
	The net $(x_\alpha)$ has the point $x$ as an accumulation point if and only if some subnet of $(x_\alpha)$ converges to $x$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	\todo{To prove $\Rightarrow$, let $K$ be the set of all pairs $(\alpha, U)$ where $\alpha \in J$ and $U$ is a neighborhood of $x$ containing $x_\alpha$. Define $(\alpha, U) \preceq (\beta, V)$ if $\alpha \preceq \beta$ and $V \subset U$. Show that $K$ is directed and use it to define the subnet.}
\end{proof}

\section{Compactness}
\begin{thm}
	$X$ is compact if and only if every net in $X$ has a convergent subnet.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	\todo{To prove $\Rightarrow$, let $B_\alpha = \{x_\beta
			\mid \alpha \preceq \beta \}$ and show that $\{B_\alpha \}$ has the finite intersection property.

		To prove $\Leftarrow$, let $\mathscr A$ be a collection of closed sets having the finite intersection property, and let $\mathscr B$ be the collection of all finite intersections of elements of $\mathscr A$, partially ordered by reverse inclusion.}
\end{proof}
